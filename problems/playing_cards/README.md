# playing cards

This directory is a set of solutions for the `playing cards` problem.

## Solution overview

The goal of this solution is not to come to a singular solution but take advantage of the expressiveness of the various languages of this repo to create basic features one would see in a common implementation of a deck of cards for either games or other.

Some of these features include

1. Create a deck of cards and print all sorted spades
2. Shuffle cards and print 5 random cards
3. Sort a shuffled deck of cards
4. Compare random cards against eachother by [spades, hearts, clubs, diamonds] in that order
5. Cut a deck of cards
6. simulate a simple game of "war"
