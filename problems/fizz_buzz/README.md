# fizz buzz

This directory is a set of solutions for the `fizz_buzz` problem.

## Solution overview

This is another trivial problem akin to the `hello_world` problem. The goal of this problem is to iterate
through a set of integers (usually linear) and under certain division based properties of the number, 
print respective strings for all properties that apply to the number.

The canonical example is that

1. If the number is divisible by 3, print "fizz"
2. If the number is divisible by 5, print "buzz"

optional

3. If the number is dividible by 7, print "baz"

Print a concatenated string of the resulting output fizz buzz properties from 1-150
